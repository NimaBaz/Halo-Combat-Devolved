# Halo-Combat-Devolved
We chose a genre that is largely non-existent on the platforms PICO-8 emulates as a challenge to push the platform to its limits. Our primary goal was as aesthetic one: 
To create a game that undoubtedly looks like Halo, but on a retro platform. Emulating early shooters made this achievable. This was done in LUA and PICO-8 engine.
